# Overview
CAC Aggrregation by Reversing and Dumping in Arrays Lightweight (Cardinal) is a tool that accurately finds callsite argument cardinalities (CAC's) and creates a easily comparable signature by aggregating them per function and dumping the result into a Bloom filter. Bloom filters are compared via the Jaccard index from which a similarity score is calculated.
